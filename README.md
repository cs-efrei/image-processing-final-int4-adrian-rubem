# P1 - TI202: Image Processing in C

## 📌 Description

This project consists of creating a BMP image processing program in C. It is divided into three main parts:
- 8-bit grayscale image processing
- 24-bit color image processing
- Histogram equalization to improve contrast

## 👥 Project Team

- Lastname Firstname (student 1)
- Lastname Firstname (student 2)
- (Optional: Lastname Firstname, student 3)

## 📂 Source Files

- `bmp8.c / bmp8.h` — Functions for grayscale image processing
- `bmp24.c / bmp24.h` — Functions for color image processing
- `main.c` — Command-line interface for the program
- `CMakeLists.txt` — CMake configuration file (optional)

## 🧱 Data Structures

- `t_bmp8`: represents a grayscale image (8-bit), with header, color table, and pixel data
- `t_bmp24`: represents a 24-bit color image, with header, pixel matrix, and image metadata
- `t_pixel`: represents a color pixel (R, G, B values)

## ✅ Implemented Features

### Part 1: 8-bit Grayscale Images
- Load and save grayscale BMP files
- Display image information (width, height, depth, size)
- Apply filters: negative, brightness, threshold (black & white), convolution (blur, sharpen, etc.)

### Part 2: 24-bit Color Images
- Load and save 24-bit BMP files
- Apply filters: negative, convert to grayscale, adjust brightness
- Convolution filters: box blur, Gaussian blur, sharpen, outline, emboss

### Part 3: Histogram Equalization
- Compute grayscale histogram
- Compute cumulative normalized histogram (CDF)
- Equalize the image to enhance contrast

## 🚧 Not Implemented Features

- Histogram equalization for color images (YUV conversion)

## 🐞 Known Issues

- Some color images may not display correctly if not aligned properly (padding issue)
- No graphical interface (only CLI)


## ⚙️ Compilation and Execution

### Compile using gcc:
```bash
gcc main.c bmp8.c bmp24.c -o image_processing -lm
```

Or with CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Run the program:
```bash
./image_processing
```

### Recommended test images:
- `barbara_gray.bmp` (grayscale)
- `flowers_color.bmp` (color)

## 📋 Task Distribution

- **Student 1**: File reading/writing, grayscale filters
- **Student 2**: Color filters, user interface, histogram equalization
- **(Student 3)**: RGB ↔ YUV conversion and color equalization (if implemented)
