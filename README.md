# P1 - TI202: Image Processing in C

## Description

This project consists of creating a BMP image processing program in C. It is divided into three main parts:
- 8-bit grayscale image processing
- 24-bit color image processing
- Histogram equalization to improve contrast

##  Project Team

- Adrian Rubem
- SaÃ¯f Bousaada

## ðŸ“‚ Source Files

- `bmp8.c / bmp8.h` â€” Functions for grayscale image processing
- `bmp24.c / bmp24.h` â€” Functions for color image processing
- `main.c` â€” Command-line interface for the program
- `CMakeLists.txt` â€” CMake configuration file (optional)

##  Data Structures

- `t_bmp8`: represents a grayscale image (8-bit), with header, color table, and pixel data
- `t_bmp24`: represents a 24-bit color image, with header, pixel matrix, and image metadata
- `t_pixel`: represents a color pixel (R, G, B values)

## âœ… Implemented Features

### Part 1: 8-bit Grayscale Images
- Load and save grayscale BMP files
- Display image information (width, height, depth, size)
- Apply filters: negative, brightness, threshold (black & white), convolution (blur, sharpen, etc.)

### Part 2: 24-bit Color Images
- Load and save 24-bit BMP files
- Apply filters: negative, convert to grayscale, adjust brightness
- Convolution filters: box blur, Gaussian blur, sharpen, outline, emboss

### Part 3: Histogram Equalization
- Compute grayscale histogram
- Compute cumulative normalized histogram (CDF)
- Equalize the image to enhance contrast

##  Not Implemented Features

- Histogram equalization for color images (YUV conversion)

##  Known Issues

- Some color images may not display correctly if not aligned properly (padding issue)
- No graphical interface (only CLI)


## Compilation and Execution

### Compile using gcc:
```bash
gcc main.c bmp8.c bmp24.c -o image_processing -lm
```

Or with CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Run the program:
```bash
./image_processing
```

### Recommended test images:
- `barbara_gray.bmp` (grayscale)
- `flowers_color.bmp` (color)

## ðŸ“‹ Task Distribution

- **Adrian**: File reading/writing, grayscale filters, read me
- **SaÃ¯f**: Color filters, user interface, histogram equalization
